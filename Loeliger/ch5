File Management and the Index  (Things Bart Massey Hates About Git.)

INDEX- a stage between the working directory and the repository.
- a set of intended or prospective modifications.
Edit in working directory, accumulate changes in index, commit.
"git commit <file>" is same as "git add <file>; git commit".
"git rm <file>; git commit" can not be so combined.
