Setting up one's own git server:
(see also Chacon)

The Goal:
to be able to-
$ git clone ssh://indi303.net:5322/mnt/Var/GitHub/Maxwell.git

Steps taken to make the above possible:

On local machine from within /path/to/projects directory:
$ git clone --bare my_project my_project.git
Then copy/scp/rsync the my_project.git directory to your server.

In the case of indi303.net, a user's public key must be appended to
their .ssh/authorized_keys file.


Alternatively, can set up an empty bare repository on your server
as follows:
$ cd /mnt/Var/GitHub
$ mkdir newproject.git
$ cd newproject.git
$ git --bare init

Then from your working machine:
From within your git repo:
## use 'indi' instead of 'origin' if already using 'origin' for github.
$ git remote add origin ssh://alex@indi303.net:5322/mnt/Var/GitHub/Maxwell.git
$ git push --set-upstream origin master

# Maxwell has remote only at indi
# Rachel has remote origin at github and indi at indi303.net:5322
# debk has remote origin at github and indi at indi303.net:5322
