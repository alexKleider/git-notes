git branch <branch> [<starting-commit>]  # defaults to current.
    # Creates a branch name but doesn't change current branch to it.
git branch   # Lists branch names in local repository
git branch -r   # in remote repository
git branch -a   # in both local and remote repositories.

git checkout <branch>  # Changes working directory to <branch>
